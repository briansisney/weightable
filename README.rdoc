Weightable
==========

Weightable allows users to track his or her weight, upload photos, and receive encouragement from friends.

•	Chart.js to visualize data
•	Zurb-Foundation Framework
•	Devise for user authentication
•	Amazon S3 for remote image storage
•	jQuery JavaScript library
•	Remotipart to enable AJAX file uploads with jQuery
